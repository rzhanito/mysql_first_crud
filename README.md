# mysql_first_crud
In this app, I've learned to add MySQL dependency to my SpringBoot project and write SQL code in Java Repository class to run it in the Controller class.
It was all learned to write a nice basic CRUD application. I'm going to make it better and learn better ways to make these kinds of applications.
Building this project was an interesting experience and I liked it.
